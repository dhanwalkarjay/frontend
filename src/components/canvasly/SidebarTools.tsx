// as their placement in a Figma-like UI (e.g., right contextual panel) is a larger feature.

// Keeping the file to avoid breaking imports if any other minor utilities were here,
// but it's not actively used in the main page layout anymore.
// You can consider deleting this file if it's confirmed to be fully unused.

// has been moved or removed as part of the UI overhaul.
